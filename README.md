## Ex:1 Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
## Aim:
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

## Algorithm:
Get an input from the user.
Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
If true, print "EVEN".
Else, print "ODD".
End the program.
## Program:
```
a=int (input ()) if 
(a%2) ==0: 
print("EVEN") 
else:  
 print("ODD")
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program has been successfully executed.


## EX1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
## Aim:
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

## Algorithm:
Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".
## Program:
```
a = (0 == True) 
b = (False== False) 
c = True + True 
d = False + 9 
print("a is", a) 
print("b is", b) 
print("c:", c) 
print("d:", d)
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program has been successfully executed.


## EX:1 Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
 ## Aim:
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

## Algorithm:
Print the character 'T'.
Print the character 'a'.
## Program:
```
print('T')
print('a')
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program has been successfully executed.

## EX1 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## Algorithm
Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
## Program:
```
a=int(input()) 
b=int(input()) 
x=complex(a,b) 
print(x) 
print(x.real) 
print(x.imag)
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program has been successfully executed.

## EX1 Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## Algorithm:
Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
Print the value stored in the variable.
## Program:
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()  
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4003475-d9f9-4fb4-b595-e47bcfc89698)


## Result:
 Thus, the program has been successfully execute.
